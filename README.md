# Continuous Integration CI Server

## Overview
This Java-based Continuous Integration (CI) server is designed to encapsulate the core functionalities of CI processes, catering to essential CI features. Developed as a part of the DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, this project emphasizes educational purposes and the practical application of CI principles.

## Features
- **Compilation:** Automated compilation of the project to ensure code integrity.
- **Testing:** Execution of automated tests to maintain code quality.
- **Notification:** Notification mechanisms to inform about the CI process outcomes.

## Installation and Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NicoleWij/Group_5_Assignment_2

# Compile


# Run


```

## Testing
The testing is implemented with Junit 5. To test you can either use the Testing feature in VS code, and then run all Java tests with Junit Jupiter. For testing using the terminal follow the instructions below, which is an example of how to test all LICs.

```bash
# Compile TEST 


# Run TEST

```

## About This Project
This project was developed as part of an assignment for DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Science. It is meant for educational purposes by the members of Group 5.

## Roadmap
While there are no planned updates, potential future improvements could focus on performance optimization and expanding test coverage.

## Compatibility and Reliability
- Backward compatibility is a priority. All changes adhere to semantic versioning.
- Extensive testing ensures reliability and correctness of the algorithm.

## Keep it Simple
Our approach is based on simplicity and clarity, avoiding over-complication in both code and documentation.
